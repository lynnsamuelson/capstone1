#Chymic Ions
This is the capstone project for my first half of curiculum (front-end develpment) at NSS.  The project was inspired by the need for better science based learning strategies.  The initial program provides a small amount of reading and then allows the user to practice identifying ions and balancing chemical equations. 

##Running the Application
Clone the repo

```
mkdir ~/projects && cd ~/projects git clone https://github.com/lynnsamuelson/capstone1.git 
```

##Serve the application

Go to the application root folder and start the server.

```
cd ~/projects/capstone1
http-server ./ 
```
Now you can open your browser and go to http://localhost:8081 (or whichever port it reports it is using) and you should see the basic mock-up. The "More" button will add more songs to the list and you can click a delete button to deltet the song from the DOM (but not the applicatoin).
